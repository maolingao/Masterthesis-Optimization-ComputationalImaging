NOCI
==============================================

NOCI(stands for Numerial Optimization in Computational Imaging) is a project by Maolin Gao, Philipp Henning and Michael Hirsch.

Main aim is by employing probabilistic numerical inference to tackle astronomical problem. Specifically making full use of image sequence to deconvolve blurry astronomical images.
